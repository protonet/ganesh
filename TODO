- remove password from bindings and store it in keychain if needed
- check the format of the information that comes from the preference plist. someone could edit that and do some malicious stuff
- use an outputBuffer for the outputStream to make the socket.m fully asynchronous
- handle image loading for tweet from url. initwithcontentsofurl is not an efficient way to do it
- don't store the ipaddress as integer. we need it as string ... seriously wtf
- the observer in socket.m has much redundant code
- we store the ip adress as integer, that makes validation easier. maybe change that later
- autoreconnect when changing node settings
- observe network for changes to decide whether to connect to server or not
- use addSubView for drawing the lock icon instead of overriding using the [vpnImage drawrRect...
- check for wellformedness of cache file when initializing the messages object. don't allow people to do malicious stuff aye
- do some sanity checks when setting the contents of tweets
- more sanity checks. bad channel info can lead to problems
- do some performance optimizations to the webview. we can't have infinite amounts of meeps in the same webview. that would totally kill us performance wise.
    - does it make more sense to have as many webviews as we have channels
      or should we keep it as it is now.

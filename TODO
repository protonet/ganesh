- remove password from bindings and store it in keychain if needed
- check the format of the information that comes from the preference plist. someone could edit that and do some malicious stuff
- use an outputBuffer for the outputStream to make the socket.m fully asynchronous
- handle image loading for tweet from url. initwithcontentsofurl is not an efficient way to do it
- don't store the ipaddress as integer. we need it as string ... seriously wtf
- the observer in socket.m has much redundant code
- we store the ip adress as integer, that makes validation easier. maybe change that later
- autoreconnect when changing node settings
- observe network for changes to decide whether to connect to server or not
